			<h2>Subtheme: Transit-Oriented Development</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Cities in the United States act as socioeconomic hubs that bring together vast quantities of people who work a variety of jobs, attend school, partake in leisure activities, and access vital needs, such as healthcare. In such densely-packed hubs, public transportation is paramount in ensuring that every member of the community is able to go about their daily lives, transporting individuals in a manner that is efficient, sustainable, and scalable. This aligns with the need for dense, lower-cost housing. As such, the idea of developing the surrounding areas of the city with transit as a critical consideration, known as Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), faces scrutiny between numerous stakeholders that lie on a spectrum between dense housing and spread out, single-family homes. In this preliminary report, we seek to better understand TOD by exploring data in the Greater Boston Area from a variety of sources, and leveraging visualizations to gain an intuitive understanding of factors such as housing density, transit proximity, corporate ownership, zoning, historically marginalized communities, and broader housing trends.
			</p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Presently, to what level is housing in Boston structured in a manner that correlates with transit accessibility? How will it change in the future?</li>
					<ul><li>This question is fundamental in the study of TOD. Housing in Boston has always been influenced by public transit, and public transit has long been built to conform to the needs of housing. It is important to understand to what level transit and housing are intertwined at the present in order to push further transit-oriented development in the correct direction. </li></ul>

				<li>How does TOD impact equity and inclusion in historically marginalized communities affected by redlining and zoning segregation?</li>
				<ul><li>The “Transforming the Urban Space Through Transit-Oriented Development: The 3V Approach“ article mentions that by allocating part of the new development to affordable housing, we can enhance job opportunities and services for low income residents, in light of the risk of gentrification from TOD that does not take low-income and marginalized communities into consideration. Page 10 of the MAPC report states that “"More housing near transit is needed to meet this growing demand and to prevent displacement of low- and moderate-income families living in transit-rich neighborhoods as real estate prices rise.” Evidently, although TOD can be had with the intent of improving equity and inclusion in historically marginalized communities, doing so without deliberate thought could potentially have the opposite effect, pushing low-income individuals out. Answering this question will ensure that TOD benefits historically marginalized communities. </li></ul>

				<li>What are the key roles of different stakeholders in promoting TOD in the Greater Boston area? </li>
					<ul><li>The main overview mentions that TOD has experienced pushback due to transit being a public investment and TOD itself requiring planning and coordination among various stakeholders. For this reason, it is important to acknowledge who the key stakeholders are in TOD and what their rules are. This includes residents in the areas surrounding the transit stations, real estate developers, the transit agencies (MBTA in Boston’s case), local governments, and local businesses, as mentioned in mass.gov’s description of multi-family zoning. I observe this simply walking through different areas of Boston, observing the disparities between highly commercial areas, neighborhoods with towering luxury glass skyscrapers, and dense, aging apartment buildings. Addressing this question will ensure TOD can occur under the support of the community and without prohibitive roadblocks. </li></ul>
				
				<li>How can we build support for TOD and address the concerns of local residents and stakeholders, particularly around zoning changes and in light of the MBTA Communities Act?</li>
					<ul><li>The provided overview for TOD mentions concerns by suburban communities such as Milton and Chelsea by the Sea regarding density, traffic, and loss of neighborhood character. It is also mentioned in an article from Assignment 1 (Houses are too expensive. Apartments are too small. Is this a fix?) that developers push back against zoning reform and upzoning due to concerns about property value and investment as well. Finally, page 24 of the MAPC report mentions “with increased demand for housing comes the potential for displacement of low-income, minority, immigrant, and transit-dependent populations”. Answering this question is fundamental in ensuring that people who can benefit from these reforms are informed and can express their support, while those who may not financially benefit can understand the necessity of the reforms for the benefit of the community.</li></ul>

			<p>Figure 1. gives us the opportunity to observe the present state of zoning and how it correlates with the MBTA’s transit line layout. Shown above are three major methods of commuting into and out of Boston for many people in the Greater Boston Area: commuter bus, commuter rail, and rapid transit. We see that the percentage of single-family housing set aside through zoning is roughly correlated with proximity to the MBTA lines. That is, there is a higher quantity of single-family homes set aside near MBTA lines, which could limit the potential for more dense housing development. This is counterintuitive to Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) principles, as higher housing density near transit lines would make for more efficient use of space, allowing residents to commute easily without personal transportation. Zoning that forces low housing density, even in areas with robust public transportation, means more land is allocated for driving and parking rather than for increasing the housing supply. As a result, space is being underutilized where transit could otherwise support greater urban density and address the housing crisis in the Greater Boston area.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>To gain another perspective on the relation between zoning and the MBTA, we observe Figure 2., which counts the number of MBTA stops by municipality, highlighted by the percent of non-white population in each municipality. As in Figure 1., we observe little correlation between the single-family percentage and the number of MBTA stops, rather than a higher number of MBTA stops corresponding to a lower percentage of single-family zoning. This lack of correlation suggests that areas with more transit access are not prioritizing higher-density development. We also see little correlation to marginalized communities, indicating a gap in reversing the disadvantages placed upon historically marginalized groups. In fact, much of the single-family zoning appears to occur in areas with low marginalized population. This disconnect highlights how municipalities are not addressing broader equity and housing challenges in these areas. </p>

			<p>To add further context to the distribution of MBTA stops, we observe in Figure 3. the graphical spread of the number of MBTA stops by municipality. The plot has been capped at 500 to account for Boston being an outlier. The uneven distribution of public transportation highlights that certain municipalities will have to demonstrate greater focus on upzoning to increase housing density near transit stops. There is a need for intentional planning to ensure that TOD benefits underserved communities, many of which are underserved due to historical marginalization by redlining and zoning practices.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>Redlining was the process of governments systematically denying public services to residents of certain neighborhoods, often based on racial or ethnic composition. This occurred by way of designating certain areas on a scale from "A" to "D". In other words, areas were labelled as "Best", "Still Desirable", "Definitely Declining", and "Hazardous". Redlining contributed to long-term economic disadvantages and housing segregation, and the effects of which are apparant in the routes created by the MBTA. It can be seen in Figure 4. that the rapid transit lines more directly serve "A" and "B" group areas, with "C" and "D" group areas being passed by or avoided by the lines, further providing a disadvantage to these historically marginalized communities. This aligns with the zoning laws observed in Figures 1. and 2., and thus also highlights the necessity for zoning reform in a manner that attempts to reverse the economic disadvantages and housing segregation marginalized communities have experienced.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>Figure 5. supports the conclusion that the long-term effects of redlining are apparent in the MBTA network. The MBTA Communities Act, which mandates zoning reforms for communities serviced by the MBTA, seeks to address some of these historical effects on marginalized demographics. Figure 5. breaks down communities serviced by the MBTA by demographic characteristics, showcasing differences in demographic between MBTA and non-MBTA communities. It can be observed that areas not served by the MBTA will tend to have a lower population of white people, and greater numbers of Latinos and mixed-race individuals. This showcases the need for the MBTA Communities Act to incorporate equity considerations more effectively, ensuring that all neighborhoods benefit from improved transit-oriented development (TOD), regardless of their demographics.</p>

			<p>Figure 6. ties back the low single-family zoning correlation with marginalized communities. Apart from highly populated locations where there is 0% single-family zoning, there tends to be a trend of more marginalized populations having a high percentage allocated to single-family homes through zoning. This highlights that zoning is preventing higher-density housing from being built in marginalized communities and shows the need for upzoning and for TOD, which can contribute to reversing the issue that originated in redlining practices.</p>

				<img src="Plots/Owner-Occupancy Rate in Marginalized Communities.png" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"/>

			</figure>

			<p>The negative effects of historical redlining and zoning practices in the Greater Boston area have improved only slightly over the last 20 years. Figure 7. shows that Boston municipalities with a low marginalized population have experienced decreasing owner occupancy rates. In these areas, wealthier, predominantly white communities have seen increased investment in housing by developers and owners who do not reside in the properties they own. These investors often purchase properties for rental income or future resale, driving up housing prices and reducing the availability of owner-occupied homes. In contrast, communities with higher marginalized populations have seen more stable owner occupancy rates, suggesting that these areas remain more reliant on long-term residents who live in and own their homes, but that there exists a gap in housing for new residence who wish to reside in the area. This shift emphasizes the growing divide in housing market dynamics between wealthier, predominantly white areas and more marginalized communities, as investor-driven development increasingly targets richer neighborhoods.</p>

			</figure>

			<p>Investor-driven development is further highlighted by observing condominium conversions concentrated along MBTA lines. These conversions involve increasing the number of housing units within existing properties, allowing developers to rent out and accommodate a greater number of people. Figures 8., 9. and 10. illustrate that such development is focused primarily near MBTA lines, where increased housing density aligns with transit-oriented development (TOD) principles. Figure 8. shows condominium conversions to increase housing density, Figure 9. shows residential sales, and Figure 10. shows price changes in residential flips. While TOD benefits stakeholders by promoting efficient land use, increasing housing, supplementing city activity, and allowing developers to address an underserved section of the market, greater support needs to be gathered. These conversions and increase in dense housing development will require careful collaboration among the various stakeholders, including local governments and municipalities, affluent single-family homeowners, marginalized communities, and housing developers. Each of these groups has their own differing levels to benefit from TOD, making it essential to balance the need for increased housing density with the preservation of community interests and equitable development.</p>

			<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Exploring our analysis questions through data-driven visualizations has proved to be paramount in increasing our understanding of the housing issues plaguing the Greater Boston area. We have explored the current and immediate past manners in which Boston housing is structures and correlates with MBTA accessibility through visualizations such as in Figures 1., 2., and 3. We have also observed the historical roots that explain why certain marginalized communities are underserved, as a result of predatory zoning and redlining efforts outlined in Figures 4., 5., 6., and 7. These visualizations revealed that the marginalized communities still feel these effects to this day, and that further TOD and upzoning needs to make addressing these issues a priority. Then, questions related to the roles of stakeholders and the difficulties of building support for TOD are explored in Figures 8., 9., and 10. These visualizations revealed the interplay and interactions between governments, homeowners, marginalizaed communities, and developers, calling into question their roles and the emphasis on gaining these groups' support.
			
			Our data-driven analysis has shown that Transit-Oriented Development can be a powerful tool to address housing density issues and promote equitable urban growth in Greater Boston. However, it also underscores the importance of prioritizing the needs of historically marginalized communities and ensuring that upzoning and TOD initiatives are inclusive. The continued collaboration of all stakeholders will be essential to realizing a more equitable and efficient housing future.</p>
