			<h2>Subtheme: Transit-Oriented Development</h2>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Cities in the United States act as socioeconomic hubs that bring together vast quantities of people who work a variety of jobs, attend school, partake in leisure activities, and access vital needs, such as healthcare. In such densely-packed hubs, public transportation is paramount in ensuring that every member of the community is able to go about their daily lives, transporting individuals in a manner that is efficient, sustainable, and scalable. This aligns with the need for dense, lower-cost housing. As such, the idea of developing the surrounding areas of the city with transit as a critical consideration, known Transit-Oriented-Development (TOD), faces scrutiny between numerous stakeholders that lie on a spectrum between dense housing and spread out, single-family homes. In this preliminary report, we seek to better understand TOD by exploring data in the Greater Boston Area from a variety of sources, and leveraging visualizations to gain an intuitive understanding of factors such as housing density, transit proximity, corporate ownerships, zoning, historically marginalized communities, and broader housing trends.
			</p>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How can we build support for TOD and address the concerns of local residents and stakehulders, particularly around zoning changes and in light of the MBTA Communities Act?</li>
					<ul><li>The provided overview for TOD mentions concerns by suburban communities such as Milton and Chelsea by the Sea regarding density, traffic, and loss of neighborhood character. It is also mentioned in an article from Assignment 1 (Houses are too expensive. Apartments are too small. Is this a fix?) that developers push back against zoning reform and upzoning due to concerns about property value and investment as well. Finally, page 24 of the MAPC report mentions “with increased demand for housing comes the potential for displacement of low-income, minority, immigrant, and transit-dependent populations”. Answering this question is fundamental in ensuring that people who can benefit from these reforms are informed and can express their support, while those who may not financially benefit can understand the necessity of the reforms for the benefit of the community.</li></ul>
				<li>How does TOD impact equity and inclusion in historically marginalized communities affected by redlining and zoning segregation?</li>
					<ul><li>The “Transforming the Urban Space Through Transit-Oriented Development: The 3V Approach“ article mentions that by allocating part of the new development to affordable housing, we can enhance job opportunities and services for low income residents, in light of the risk of gentrification from TOD that does not take low-income and marginalized communities into consideration. Page 10 of the MAPC report states that “"More housing near transit is needed to meet this growing demand and to prevent displacement of low- and moderate-income families living in transit-rich neighborhoods as real estate prices rise.” Evidently, although TOD can be had with the intent of improving equity and inclusion in historically marginalized communities, doing so without deliberate thought could potentially have the opposite effect, pushing low-income individuals out. Answering this question will ensure that TOD benefits historically marginalized communities. </li></ul>
				<li>What are the key rules of different stakehulders in promoting TOD in the Greater Boston area? </li>
					<ul><li>The main overview mentions that TOD has experienced pushback due to transit being a public investment and TOD itself requiring planning and coordination among various stakehulders. For this reason, it is important to acknowledge who the key stakehulders are in TOD and what their rules are. This includes residents in the areas surrounding the transit stations, real estate developers, the transit agencies (MBTA in Boston’s case), local governments, and local businesses, as mentioned in mass.gov’s description of multi-family zoning. I observe this simply walking through different areas of Boston, observing the disparities between highly commercial areas, neighborhoods with towering luxury glass skyscrapers, and dense, aging apartment buildings. Addressing this question will ensure TOD can occur under the support of the community and without prohibitive roadblocks. </li></ul>
				<li>Presently, to what level is housing in Boston structured in a manner that correlates with transit accessibility? How will it change in the future?</li>
					<ul><li>This question is fundamental in the study of TOD. Housing in Boston has always been influenced by public transit, and public transit has long been built to conform to the needs of housing. It is important to understand to what level transit and housing are intertwined at the present in order to push further transit-oriented development in the correct direction. </li></ul>
